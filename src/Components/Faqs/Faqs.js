                        Generally not. However, every locality has different codes. I have never encountered a customer where this was a requirement for even a 24’ screen. We seen more requirements for engineering documents, and permits for very large screens, in states like California.

                        Yes! Outdoor movie projection is similar to the technology you see in a movie theater. The difference is that instead of turning out the lights, the sun goes down.

                        YES! If the audience is facing west and the screen is facing east, you will be able to start your movie earlier that with other screen placements. The reason for this is that the screen is a highly reflective surface and sunlight hitting it directly makes the start time about 15 minutes later.
