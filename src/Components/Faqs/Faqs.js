                        Generally not. However, every locality has different codes. I have never encountered a customer where this was a requirement for a 24â€™. We have seen requirements for engineering documents and permits for very large screens in states like California.

                        Yes! Outdoor movie projection is similar to the technology you see in a movie theater. The difference is that instead of turning out the lights, the sun goes down. Calculate what time you can start your movie by using this handy link from the <a href="#">US Naval Observatory</a>.

                        When setting up the screen, does sun(set) direction determine the placement of the screen?

                        YES! If the audience is facing west and the screen is facing east, you will be able to start your movie earlier that with other screen placements. The reason for this is that the screen is a highly reflective surface and sunlight hitting it directly makes the start time about 15 minutes later.

                        The benefits and aesthetics of front versus rear projection go beyond light loss. Loss is about 10%. Again your application requirements are the important issue. Both front and rear have benefits and drawbacks.
